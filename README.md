# RED Torch

Red Torch is a very very (very) simple iOS app that allows you to have a red torch
using your screen. The App is based on storyboard, so there is wider device range that can run it.

## Running

You can run it if you have an IPhone and a mac.

1. Plug iPhone to your mac.
2. Select your device in the middle top in the XCode.
3. Press run it.
4. App should be installed, but you will need to change settings in order to run it.

    Go to Settings -> General -> VPN and device managment?(or something like that) -> Apple Development -> Red Torch(Click)
5. Enjoy it, altough it's not too bright is it?

If you see an issue, tell it.
